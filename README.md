# AlexToTheRescue
Final Project of CG2111A by Group B04-4B (AY23/24 Sem 2) 

## Project Description
Alex, our robotic vehicle, is specifically designed to address the challenges of locating and identifying victims trapped in disaster-stricken or obstacle-laden environments.  
To simulate scenarios resembling real-world crises, Alex is deployed in a controlled space filled with various obstructions, simulating debris, or collapsed structures typically found in disaster sites. The primary mission for Alex is to conduct a 'search and rescue' operation by navigating through these impediments within a stringent six-minute window to identify victims marked by distinct color codes: "green" for healthy but trapped individuals, and "red" for those who are injured, and lastly generating an accurate map of its environment.  
To achieve its objectives, Alex is equipped with sophisticated navigation and control systems. It operates under teleoperation, where commands are issued from a remote operator via a laptop interfaced with a master control program running on a Raspberry Pi. This setup converts commands into actionable movements controlled via the Arduino Mega 2560 board, ensuring precise maneuvering and interaction within the simulated environment, all while utilizing RPLIDAR data to minimize collisions with objects and ensuring the precision of the environment map it produces. These functionalities allow Alex to not only identify the victims with high accuracy but also map the entire environment meticulously. This mapping is crucial for post-operation review and planning future rescue missions in similar settings.
